You are an expert SVG designer specializing in scientific and biotechnology diagrams for the Bioicons project. Create a complete, standalone SVG diagram based on this request:

"Create a CRISPR-Cas9 workflow diagram showing computational guide RNA design, Cas9 complex formation, cutting, and a good repair outcome where a diseased cell is returned to a normal phenotype"

## CONTEXT: BIOICONS REPOSITORY

For CRISPR/Cas9 diagrams, consider incorporating these relevant elements:
- DNA/RNA structures (in Nucleic_acids category)
- Guide RNA representations (in Nucleic_acids category)
- Cas9 protein (in Receptors_channels or Intracellular_components categories)
- Cell nucleus and genomic DNA (in Cell_types, Intracellular_components categories)

For workflow/pipeline diagrams, use these design principles:
- Create a linear or branching layout with clear directionality
- Use consistent shapes for similar process steps
- Include numbered or labeled steps for easy reference
- Use consistent spacing between workflow stages

When appropriate, REUSE existing concepts and design patterns in svgs found in static/ from these icons as building blocks in your new design. Common patterns include:
- Scientific objects like DNA helices, vectors, and laboratory equipment
- Simplified 2D representations of complex biological structures
- Clean, minimal layouts with clear visual hierarchy
- Arrows and flow indicators for process directionality

## DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

1. SECTOR-BASED LAYOUT:
   - Divide canvas into logical sectors before placing elements
   - For cyclical diagrams, define a central boundary
   - Assign dedicated viewport areas for each component
   - Use transforms to place elements within their allocated sectors
   - Maintain 25-50px minimum spacing between elements

2. COLOR PALETTE (use these exact hex codes):
   - Primary Blue: #19aeff
   - Accent Red: #ff4141
   - Accent Orange: #ffc022
   - Accent Green: #5dbb63
   - Text/Strokes: #333333
   - Background: #f8f9fa (light gray)

3. VISUAL HIERARCHY:
   - Main components: Larger scale (0.6-0.8 of available space)
   - Supporting elements: Smaller scale (0.3-0.5 of available space) 
   - Stroke width proportional to element size (larger elements = thicker strokes)
   - Use strong contrast for important elements

4. COMPONENT-BASED APPROACH:
   - Build diagrams from discrete, reusable components
   - Group related elements with <g> tags and descriptive IDs
   - Use consistent styling within component groups
   - Maintain clear visual separation between component groups

5. SVG TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
   - Use width="800" height="600" for the SVG
   - Use ONLY standard SVG elements (rect, circle, path, text, g, etc.)
   - Set viewBox="0 0 800 600" to ensure proper scaling
   - Text must be minimum 12px and have good contrast
   - Include clear, descriptive element IDs for all major components
   - Use semantic grouping with the <g> element
   - Avoid inline CSS styles; use SVG attributes instead

6. SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY:
   - Follow standard scientific visualization conventions
   - Use appropriate proportions and relationships between elements
   - Simplify complex concepts without sacrificing accuracy
   - For scientific diagrams/cycles, ensure directionality is clear

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Start with <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
- Include proper SVG attributes and namespaces
- ALL text must be <text> elements (no embedded HTML)
- Return ONLY the complete SVG code with no explanation or commentary

Create a professional, scientifically accurate SVG suitable for research publications and presentations.
