# Design Critique: CRISPR-Cas9 Workflow Diagram

## Visual Balance
The diagram presents a stepped workflow with reasonably consistent spacing between elements, but several balance issues are present. The left-to-right flow in the upper row is visually balanced, but the large, triangular connectors directing to Steps 4 and the Outcome create significant visual weight on the right side of the composition. The icon sizes vary considerably between steps without clear justification—for instance, the computational element in Step 1 appears disproportionately large compared to other visual elements. The diagram also presents an inconsistent vertical alignment of elements within each box.

## Color Harmony
The color palette shows partial adherence to scientific visualization standards but lacks cohesion. The diagram employs functional color coding (blue for DNA/computational elements, yellow for the Cas9-gRNA complex, red for disease state, green for repair/normal state), but the selection appears arbitrary rather than systematically planned. The high contrast between the bright primary colors creates visual competition rather than harmony. The black connectors, particularly the triangular ones, introduce an additional, visually dominant color that competes with the information-carrying elements.

## Visual Hierarchy
The hierarchical structure is compromised by inconsistent visual weighting. While the numbered steps provide a clear sequence, the varying sizes and visual treatments of the icons dilute the informational priority. The "Outcome" box is appropriately differentiated with a green border but lacks sufficient visual distinction to indicate its status as the culmination of the process. The relationship between Step 3 (DNA Cutting) and Step 4 (DNA Repair) is particularly unclear due to the abrupt directional change and oversized connector.

## Readability
Text legibility is adequate but could be improved with more consistent type styling. The step titles are appropriately prominent, but the descriptive text beneath varies in position and alignment. The labels within the Step 5 circles ("Disease" and "Normal") are sized appropriately for their containers but lack sufficient contrast against their backgrounds, particularly "Disease" against the red background. The outcome text appears unnecessarily compressed within its container, reducing comfortable reading space.

## Flow
The diagram attempts to represent a sequential process but faces challenges in guiding the viewer's eye. The standard left-to-right flow established in the first three steps is disrupted by the downward triangular connectors, creating an unintuitive reading pattern. The relationship between Step 5 and the Outcome is visually emphasized with a large connector but lacks logical visual continuity with the preceding steps. The flow would benefit from a more consistent directional strategy.

OVERALL SCORE: 62/100

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:

1. Standardize the icon sizes across all steps to maintain visual consistency and balance.
2. Replace the large triangular connectors with more subtle directional indicators that don't overpower the informational elements.
3. Implement a more refined color system following Bioicons guidelines—use a primary color for process steps and accent colors only for highlighting critical differentiations.
4. Establish consistent internal padding and alignment for text elements within each box.
5. Create clearer visual distinction between the process steps and the outcome by using a different shape or increased size for the outcome element.
6. Improve the color contrast for the text labels, particularly for "Disease" on the red background.
7. Reorganize the layout to maintain a consistent left-to-right or top-to-bottom flow direction without abrupt changes.
8. Add subtle background tinting to group related steps (e.g., DNA manipulation steps) to enhance information hierarchy.
9. Increase the padding in the Outcome box to improve text legibility and visual breathing room.
10. Standardize the connector line weights and styles throughout the diagram for visual cohesion.
