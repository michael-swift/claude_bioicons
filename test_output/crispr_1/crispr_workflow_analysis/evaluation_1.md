# Design Critique: CRISPR-Cas9 Workflow Diagram

## Visual Balance
The diagram presents a sequential workflow with reasonably distributed elements, but exhibits several balance issues. The five steps are arranged in an inverted "L" shape rather than a more intuitive linear or circular flow. The large black triangular arrows directing from Step 3 to Step 4 and from Step 5 to the Outcome are disproportionately heavy compared to the standard horizontal arrows connecting other steps. This creates visual weight inconsistency that disrupts the overall balance. The icons within each step vary significantly in size and style, further contributing to an unbalanced appearance.

## Color Harmony
The color palette lacks cohesion and systematic application. The diagram employs blue (Step 1, DNA elements), yellow/red (Step 2), blue again (Step 3), green/blue (Step 4), and red/green (Step 5) without establishing a clear color system. The final outcome box uses a green border that doesn't clearly connect to the established visual language. While some biomedical conventions are followed (red for disease, green for normal/healthy), the overall color scheme appears arbitrary rather than deliberately designed to enhance understanding of biological processes or workflows.

## Visual Hierarchy
The hierarchy is partially effective but inconsistent. Step numbers and titles are properly emphasized, establishing primary importance. However, the relationship between text descriptions and their corresponding icons is not consistently handled. Some icons (like in Step 2) dominate visually while others (like in Step 1) are more subdued. The large black triangular arrows draw excessive attention, competing with the actual process steps for visual dominance and creating confusion about what elements deserve primary focus.

## Readability
Text readability is generally acceptable, with appropriately sized step labels. The descriptive text below each step number is consistent in size and placement. However, the labels within the Step 5 circles ("Disease" and "Normal") could benefit from higher contrast or slightly larger text. The "Outcome" text is properly emphasized, but the two-line description beneath it lacks visual separation or hierarchy between the lines to enhance readability.

## Flow
The diagram's flow has significant problems. The abrupt change from a horizontal flow (Steps 1-3) to a vertical arrangement (Steps 3-4-5-Outcome) creates an awkward reading pattern. The large diagonal arrows attempt to direct the viewer but their excessive visual weight and inconsistency with the other connectors actually disrupt flow comprehension. The transition points are not positioned optimally, particularly the connection from Step 3 to Step 4.

OVERALL SCORE: 65/100

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:

1. Redesign the flow pattern to follow a consistent direction (either left-to-right or top-to-bottom) throughout the entire workflow.
2. Standardize connector arrows to use the same weight, style, and proportion throughout the diagram.
3. Develop a cohesive color system where specific colors represent consistent elements (e.g., DNA elements, protein components, cellular structures) across all steps.
4. Balance the size and visual weight of icons within each step to create more consistency.
5. Increase the contrast between text and background in the Step 5 circles for better readability.
6. Add subtle visual cues (like numbering or connecting lines) to reinforce the process sequence.
7. Align icons more precisely within their containers for a more polished appearance.
8. Introduce a subtle background color or boundary to visually group related steps (e.g., DNA modification steps vs. cellular response steps).
9. Add a legend explaining the color coding to improve interpretation of the diagram's visual language.
10. Refine the final outcome box to visually connect it to the preceding steps, perhaps by incorporating elements or colors from earlier steps to show the culmination of the process.
