# Visual Design Critique: CRISPR-Cas9 Workflow Diagram

## Visual Balance
The diagram employs a grid-based layout with two rows of three boxes, which provides a fundamental structure. However, there are significant balance issues. The large black diagonal arrow creates an asymmetrical visual weight that dominates the central area and disrupts the otherwise clean flow. The icons within each step vary considerably in size and positioning - some are centered while others (like in Step 1) are bottom-aligned, creating uneven visual distribution. The top row (light blue background) and bottom row (light green background) create a reasonable segmentation, but the transition between them is jarring due to the oversized diagonal connector.

## Color Harmony
The color palette shows inconsistent application across the diagram. While there appears to be an attempt at a cohesive scheme with blues, greens, and accent colors, the execution lacks refinement. The yellow oval with red element in Step 2 appears disconnected from the broader color language. The transition from red "Disease" to green "Normal" in Step 5 has appropriate semantic meaning but uses overly saturated tones that compete for attention rather than complementing the overall palette. The blue icons in Steps 1 and 3 use a similar hue but inconsistent styling. Background colors (light blue and light green) create a meaningful separation but would benefit from more subtle differentiation.

## Visual Hierarchy
The diagram struggles with establishing clear hierarchy. The title "CRISPR-Cas9 Workflow" is appropriately prominent, but from there, the hierarchy becomes muddled. The step numbers compete with the step descriptions, and the relationship between text and icons isn't consistently established. The large diagonal arrow draws excessive attention and breaks the logical progression. The "Outcome" box has different internal structure than the "Step" boxes, creating confusion about its relationship to the workflow.

## Readability
Text sizing is generally adequate but inconsistently applied. The step numbers and primary descriptions have good legibility, but some text elements like "Disease" and "Normal" in Step 5 are unnecessarily small. The positioning of text relative to icons lacks consistency. The "Corrected" label in the Outcome box appears to float without clear connection to the icon above it. Overall spacing between elements is inconsistent, with some areas feeling crowded while others have excessive whitespace.

## Flow
The linear progression from Steps 1-3 is logical with horizontal arrows indicating direction. However, the large diagonal arrow creates a disruptive break in the flow that forces the viewer to readjust. The connection between Step 5 and Outcome is clear, but the internal arrow in Step 5 (from disease to normal) creates a nested flow that isn't reflected in other steps. The overall narrative of the CRISPR-Cas9 process is present but compromised by these inconsistencies in visual flow.

OVERALL SCORE: 62/100

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:

1. Replace the oversized diagonal arrow with a standard right-turning arrow that follows the grid structure, maintaining consistent arrow styling throughout.
2. Establish a more consistent icon system with uniform sizing, styling, and positioning within each step box.
3. Refine the color palette to use 2-3 primary colors with intentional accent colors that follow established scientific visualization conventions.
4. Create clearer hierarchical differentiation between step numbers, step descriptions, and secondary labels.
5. Standardize the internal layout of each box, with consistent alignment of text and icons.
6. Reduce the saturation of the background colors to create a more subtle differentiation between process phases.
7. Ensure all icons clearly represent their scientific concepts - particularly clarify the Step 2 icon which appears abstract compared to others.
8. Add a subtle border or connector between Steps 3 and 4 to maintain the grid structure while indicating transition.
9. Align the visual weight of all arrows to create consistent directional indicators.
10. Consider adding a minimal legend or caption to explain the color-coding system used in the diagram.
